# Guestbook App

## This is a simple Guest Booking app built with Vite + React

## To run

```bash
npm install
npm run server
npm run dev
```

## Notes

Generally found this task to be achievable and not overly complex. Some areas I spent longer on

* Advanced React hooks composition
    -   When to apply useReducer vs useState
    -   How best to compose these hooks together, have I got logic in the most optimal places?
    -   Is a message-utils file convention or would I separate out these functions into different areas?
